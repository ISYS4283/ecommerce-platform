I want an ecommerce platform to which vendors can submit and purchase products for sale.

For every product submitted, the vendor will be given a $5 listing bonus.

The platform takes 5% commission on every approved order.

Vendors take 5% commission on every *external* product sold through their site.
Vendors cannot purchase their own products.

Vendors will be provided with APIs for the following:
* register vendor information
* create and update products
* initiate receipt of goods
* initiate and approve purchase orders

Vendors will be able to implement interfaces for:
* viewing inventory
* account balances
* purchasing products
